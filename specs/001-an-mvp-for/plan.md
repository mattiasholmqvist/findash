# Implementation Plan: Frontend MVP - Transaction Viewer

**Branch**: `001-an-mvp-for` | **Date**: 2025-09-24 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-an-mvp-for/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Frontend MVP for viewing accounting transactions with user authentication, infinite scroll pagination, and Swedish BAS compliance. Uses mocked data with configurable dataset size. React-based interface with TypeScript, targeting 300ms performance for optimal user experience.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with React 18.x
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Vite, React Query, React Context, Vitest
**Storage**: Local mock data service (no backend integration required)
**Testing**: Vitest for component, integration, and unit testing
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (desktop and tablet support)
**Project Type**: web - frontend only (Option 2 structure: frontend/ directory)
**Performance Goals**: <300ms response time for transaction list loading and scroll events
**Constraints**: No backend changes, mocked data only, Swedish accounting compliance (BAS)
**Scale/Scope**: MVP scope - single transaction viewer page with configurable dataset size

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Domain-Driven Design Compliance
- [x] Feature starts with domain model identification (Transaction, Account entities)
- [x] Ubiquitous language used in requirements (Swedish BAS terminology)
- [x] Bounded context boundaries clearly defined (Accounting Transaction domain)
- [x] Business logic contained in domain aggregates (minimal for frontend MVP)

### CQRS Architecture Compliance
- [x] Commands and queries clearly separated (Read-only transaction queries)
- [N/A] Write operations modify state through aggregates (no write operations in MVP)
- [x] Read operations use optimized projections (transaction list views)
- [x] No business logic in query handlers (simple data display)

### Event Sourcing Compliance
- [N/A] Domain events identified for state changes (no state changes in MVP)
- [N/A] Events capture business intent, not just data (read-only MVP)
- [N/A] Event schemas are versioned (no events in MVP)
- [N/A] Aggregate reconstruction from events planned (mocked data only)

### AWS Serverless Compliance
- [N/A] Lambda functions follow single responsibility (frontend only, no backend)
- [N/A] DynamoDB partition key strategy defined (no backend integration)
- [N/A] Stateless function design verified (frontend application)
- [N/A] Managed services prioritized over custom infrastructure (no backend changes)

### TypeScript Compliance
- [x] All interfaces and types defined (Transaction, Account, User interfaces)
- [x] No `any` types without justification (strict TypeScript required)
- [x] Domain models have comprehensive types (Swedish BAS compliance types)
- [x] API contracts use TypeScript interfaces (mock service interfaces)
- [x] Filenames use kebab-case convention (transaction-viewer.tsx, etc.)

```

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - frontend/ directory structure for React application

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (None required)
