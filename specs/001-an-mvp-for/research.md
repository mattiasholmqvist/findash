# Research: Frontend MVP - Transaction Viewer

## Technology Decisions

### React 18.x with TypeScript
**Decision**: Use React 18.x with functional components and TypeScript 5.x
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for TypeScript everywhere
- React 18 provides concurrent features for better performance
- Functional components align with modern React patterns
- Strong TypeScript support for type safety

**Alternatives considered**: Vue.js, Angular
**Rejected because**: React aligns with constitutional frontend standards and has better TypeScript integration for our use case

### State Management: React Query + React Context
**Decision**: Use React Query for server state and React Context for local state
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement specified in frontend standards
- React Query optimizes data fetching and caching for transaction lists
- React Context suitable for simple authentication state
- Avoids complexity of Redux for MVP scope

**Alternatives considered**: Redux Toolkit, Zustand
**Rejected because**: Overkill for MVP scope, constitutional preference for React Query

### Build Tool: Vite
**Decision**: Use Vite for development and build tooling
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for Vite with code splitting
- Fast development server and hot module replacement
- Optimized production builds with automatic code splitting
- Better performance than webpack-based tools

**Alternatives considered**: Create React App, webpack
**Rejected because**: Constitutional mandate for Vite, better performance characteristics

### Testing: Vitest
**Decision**: Use Vitest for all testing levels (unit, integration, component)
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for Vitest testing
- Better integration with Vite build system
- Jest-compatible API with better performance
- Built-in TypeScript support

**Alternatives considered**: Jest, React Testing Library standalone
**Rejected because**: Constitutional mandate, performance benefits of Vite integration

## Swedish BAS Compliance Research

### BAS Account Classes Implementation
**Decision**: Implement complete BAS classes 1-8 with proper Swedish terminology
**Rationale**:
- Legal requirement for Swedish accounting compliance
- Classes provide structured categorization: Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Revenue, Cost of Sales, Operating Expenses, Financial Income/Costs, Extraordinary Items
- Enables proper financial reporting and audit compliance

**Implementation approach**:
- TypeScript enums for BAS classes
- Swedish terminology with English documentation
- Proper account number ranges (1000-1999, 2000-2999, etc.)

### Swedish Currency Formatting
**Decision**: Implement SEK formatting with proper Swedish locale
**Rationale**:
- Feature requirement for Swedish Kronor display
- Proper locale formatting (space as thousands separator)
- Swedish currency symbols and conventions

**Implementation approach**:
- Intl.NumberFormat with 'sv-SE' locale
- Currency code 'SEK'
- Proper decimal and thousands separators

## Mock Data Strategy

### Configurable Dataset Approach
**Decision**: Create mock data service with adjustable dataset sizes
**Rationale**:
- Feature requirement for configurable dataset size
- Enables testing different performance scenarios
- Supports development and demonstration needs

**Implementation approach**:
- Mock data generator with Swedish names and scenarios
- Realistic BAS account assignments
- Date ranges appropriate for Swedish fiscal year
- Configurable size parameter (50-5000 transactions)

### Realistic Swedish Scenarios
**Decision**: Generate authentic Swedish business transaction scenarios
**Rationale**:
- Feature requirement for realistic Swedish accounting scenarios
- Better demonstration of BAS compliance
- Relevant for target user testing

**Data patterns**:
- Swedish company names and suppliers
- Common Swedish business transaction types
- Proper VAT (moms) handling scenarios
- Seasonal business patterns

## Performance Optimization Research

### Infinite Scroll Implementation
**Decision**: Use React Virtual for efficient infinite scroll
**Rationale**:
- Feature requirement for infinite scroll pagination
- Performance target of <300ms response
- Efficient rendering of large transaction lists
- Memory optimization for large datasets

**Alternatives considered**: Manual infinite scroll, React Window
**Rejected because**: React Virtual provides better TypeScript support and performance optimization

### 300ms Performance Target
**Decision**: Implement performance monitoring and optimization strategies
**Rationale**:
- Feature requirement for 300ms loading/scroll response
- Critical for user experience in high-volume transaction viewing
- Enables responsive interaction with large datasets

**Optimization strategies**:
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Memoization of transaction components
- Optimized re-rendering with React.memo
- Efficient data filtering and sorting

## Authentication Strategy

### Username/Password Implementation
**Decision**: Implement basic username/password authentication with local storage
**Rationale**:
- Feature clarification specified individual user accounts
- MVP scope appropriate for basic auth
- No backend integration required
- Sufficient for demonstration purposes

**Implementation approach**:
- Simple login form with validation
- Local storage for session persistence
- Protected routes for transaction viewer
- Basic user state management with React Context

**Security considerations**:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure session handling within browser
- Proper logout functionality
- Basic brute force protection

## Component Architecture

### Atomic Design Principles
**Decision**: Follow atomic design methodology for component structure
**Rationale**:
- Scalable component architecture
- Reusable UI elements
- Easy testing and maintenance
- Professional interface requirement

**Component hierarchy**:
- Atoms: Button, Input, Currency, Date components
- Molecules: TransactionRow, SearchBar, Pagination components
- Organisms: TransactionList, LoginForm, Header components
- Templates: DashboardTemplate, AuthTemplate
- Pages: TransactionViewer, Login pages

### Responsive Design Strategy
**Decision**: Mobile-first responsive design with CSS Grid and Flexbox
**Rationale**:
- Feature requirement for desktop and tablet support
- Professional interface for business users
- Modern CSS layout techniques
- Better performance on mobile devices

**Breakpoints**:
- Mobile: 320px-768px
- Tablet: 769px-1024px
- Desktop: 1025px+

## Error Handling Strategy

### Error Boundaries and Graceful Degradation
**Decision**: Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messaging
**Rationale**:
- Feature requirement for graceful empty state handling
- Professional interface standard
- Better user experience during errors

**Implementation approach**:
- React Error Boundaries for component errors
- Loading states for data fetching
- Empty states for no transactions
- Network error handling with retry mechanisms
- User-friendly error messages in Swedish
