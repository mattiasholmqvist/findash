# Feature Specification: Frontend MVP - Transaction Viewer

**Feature Branch**: `001-an-mvp-for`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "an mvp for the frontend application with a simple page viewing the accounting transactions. use mocked data as a start. don't touch any backend code."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Frontend MVP with transaction viewing functionality
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: Accounting users, Controllers, Business stakeholders
   � Actions: View transactions, Filter transactions, Navigate interface
   � Data: Accounting transactions (mocked initially)
   � Constraints: No backend changes, MVP scope only
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Transaction data structure marked for clarification
   � User authentication/access control needs clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Clear user flow: Access application � View transaction list
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement focused on MVP capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities: Transaction, Account, User Session
7. Run Review Checklist
   � Some clarifications needed for data structure and access patterns
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24
- Q: How should users access the application? → A: Basic user accounts - individual username/password login
- Q: What's the appropriate pagination approach for the MVP? → A: Infinite scroll (load more as user scrolls)
- Q: What transaction categories should be supported for Swedish accounting compliance? → A: Detailed BAS classes (1-8: Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Revenue, etc.)
- Q: What volume of mocked transaction data should be provided to demonstrate the MVP functionality effectively? → A: Configurable dataset size
- Q: What performance target should the MVP meet for transaction list loading and scrolling? → A: 300ms

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an accounting professional or business controller, I want to access a web-based interface where I can view a list of accounting transactions so that I can monitor financial activity and identify specific transactions for review or analysis.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I access the FinDash application, **When** I navigate to the transaction viewer, **Then** I see a list of accounting transactions with essential details
2. **Given** I am viewing the transaction list, **When** transactions are displayed, **Then** I can see transaction date, description, amount, and account information for each entry
3. **Given** I am on the transaction viewer page, **When** I want to review specific transactions, **Then** I can scan through the list and identify transactions by their key attributes
4. **Given** the system uses mocked data, **When** I access the transaction viewer, **Then** I see realistic sample transactions that demonstrate the intended functionality

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there are no transactions to display (empty state)?
- How does the interface handle very long transaction descriptions or account names?
- What occurs if the mocked data fails to load?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a paginated list of accounting transactions with date, description, amount, and account information
- **FR-002**: System MUST use configurable mocked transaction data (adjustable dataset size) that represents realistic Swedish accounting scenarios
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a clean, professional interface suitable for business users
- **FR-004**: System MUST display transaction amounts in Swedish Kronor (SEK) with proper currency formatting
- **FR-005**: System MUST show transaction dates in Swedish date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle empty states gracefully when no transactions are available
- **FR-007**: System MUST be responsive and accessible on standard business devices (desktop, tablet)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide individual user accounts with username/password authentication for secure access to transaction data
- **FR-009**: System MUST support infinite scroll pagination that loads additional transactions as users scroll down the list
- **FR-010**: System MUST categorize transactions using Swedish BAS account classes (1: Assets, 2: Liabilities, 3: Equity, 4: Revenue, 5: Cost of Sales, 6: Operating Expenses, 7: Financial Income/Costs, 8: Extraordinary Items)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System MUST load transaction list and respond to scroll events within 300ms for optimal user experience

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Transaction**: Represents individual accounting entries with date, description, amount, account reference, and Swedish compliance metadata
- **Account**: Represents chart of accounts entries following Swedish BAS (accounting standards) structure
- **Mock Data Service**: Provides realistic Swedish accounting transaction samples for MVP demonstration
