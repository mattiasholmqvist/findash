# Tasks: Frontend MVP - Transaction Viewer

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-an-mvp-for/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: TypeScript 5.x with React 18.x, Vite, React Query, Vitest
   → Structure: Web app (frontend/ directory)
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Transaction, Account, User entities → TypeScript model tasks
   → contracts/mock-api.yaml: Auth, transactions, accounts endpoints → contract test tasks
   → research.md: React Virtual, Swedish BAS, mock data strategy → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Vite project init, TypeScript config, React dependencies
   → Tests: API contract tests, component integration tests
   → Core: TypeScript models, React components, mock services
   → Integration: React Query setup, context providers, routing
   → Polish: unit tests, performance optimization, accessibility
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same component/service = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app structure**: `frontend/src/`, `frontend/tests/`

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts** (mock-api.yaml):
   - Each endpoint → contract test task [P] (T007-T012)
   - Each schema → TypeScript type task [P] (T019-T023)

2. **From Data Model**:
   - Transaction entity → model + validation task [P] (T020)
   - Account entity → model + BAS compliance task [P] (T021)
   - User entity → auth types task [P] (T022)
   - MockDataService → generator service task [P] (T024)

3. **From User Stories** (quickstart.md):
   - Authentication scenario → integration test [P] (T013)
   - Transaction display scenario → integration test [P] (T014)
   - Infinite scroll scenario → integration test [P] (T015)
   - BAS filtering scenario → integration test [P] (T016)
   - Responsive design scenario → integration test [P] (T017)

4. **Ordering Applied**:
   - Setup (T001-T006) → Tests (T007-T018) → Types (T019-T023) → Services (T024-T028) → Components (T029-T044) → Integration (T045-T050) → Polish (T051-T062)
   - TDD enforced: All tests before implementation
   - Constitutional compliance: TypeScript strict typing, kebab-case filenames, React patterns

**Total Tasks**: 62 tasks with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities
**Estimated Development Time**: 3-4 weeks for experienced React/TypeScript developer
**Critical Path**: Setup → Contract Tests → Types → Services → Core Components → Integration → Polish
